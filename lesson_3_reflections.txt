When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    This provides both an external backup, and also facilitates collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to pull changes manually so that you don't pull changes while you're in the middle of working on something. Also pushing and pulling manually helps prevent pushing changes that aren't ready for public viewing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a GitHub term for when you copy another repository into your account. Clones are copied repositories, and can exist on your own computer, or can be a copy of your github repository on your computer. Branches are versions of a file that started from a common version, but may have different changes to them. These changes are maintained as separate paths from the root file.
