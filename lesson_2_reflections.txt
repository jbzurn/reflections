What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, git creates a hidden folder for
	tracking purposes. You need to initialize git in a directory in order
	to start using git for a project. Initially the repository will be
	empty.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows you to prepare multiple files to be committed in one commit. It also gives you control over which files are committed.  This is different from the working directory, which simply is
	a repository for all the current files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By comparing the staging area with the last commit, and observing the differences.
